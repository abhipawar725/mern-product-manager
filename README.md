# mern-product-manager
This is a full-stack Admin Panel built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows an admin to sign up, log in, and perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products. The public-facing side displays a product list that is visible to all users.
